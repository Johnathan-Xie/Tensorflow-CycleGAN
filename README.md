# Tensorflow-CycleGAN
This repository supports training and generation of unpaired image to image data.

Model structure from https://machinelearningmastery.com/cyclegan-tutorial-with-keras/; instancenormalization.py from https://github.com/keras-team/keras-contrib

Note: Default Hyperparameters are fit to the horse-to-zebra dataset.  New datasets will likely require hyperparameter fitting for good results.
